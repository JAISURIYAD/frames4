        MOTIVATE YOURSELF

        Simple. Start solving more simple problems. Just think how you learn riding a cycle or learn swimming. The same concept apply here. While learning cycling and swimming, you do not jump to next level faster. Because it will hurt you physically. That is the reason automatically you are going slowly. But while doing Programming you do not get hurt physically. So you move fast and mentally get hurt. Go slow. Never compare with others.
